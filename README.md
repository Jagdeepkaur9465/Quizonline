I am building an online quiz app. It is a mobile application that allows users to participate in quizzes, answer questions, and test their knowledge on various topics. These apps are designed to offer an interactive and engaging way for users to learn, challenge themselves, and compete with others.
Technologies used:
Kotlin: Preferred language for Android app development. 
Firebase Realtime Database.
Navigation Component: For navigating between different screensscreens.
Create wireframes or mockups for each screen of the app, including the quiz list, question, and result screens.
